ðŸ“Œ Objective

Develop a system to detect and classify traffic signs from video.

Apply image processing techniques with OpenCV (HSV color filtering, contour detection, template matching).

Test the system on real video samples.

âœ… Results

The program successfully detects and classifies common traffic signs, such as:

No Entry / Wrong Way

Keep Right

No Parking / No Stopping

Children, Slow, etc.

Detected signs are shown with a green bounding box and label name on the video.

The system overlays student IDs on the video for identification.
